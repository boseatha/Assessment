Adding Teams and Team Tasks to the Fullstack TypeScript App

Overview:

The goal is to introduce new resource types, namely Teams and Team Tasks, in the existing fullstack TypeScript app. We'll need to make modifications to both the API server and the frontend application to support these features.

Plan
Backend (API Server)
Database Schema Changes:

Create a teams table to store information about teams.
Create a team_tasks table to store tasks associated with a team.
Establish relationships between the teams table and the users table.
Establish relationships between the team_tasks table and the teams table.


API Endpoints:

Create API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for teams.
POST /api/teams - Create a new team.
GET /api/teams - Retrieve all teams.
GET /api/teams/:teamId - Retrieve a specific team.
PUT /api/teams/:teamId - Update a team's information.
DELETE /api/teams/:teamId - Delete a team.
Create API endpoints to handle CRUD operations for team tasks.
POST /api/teams/:teamId/tasks - Create a new task for a team.
GET /api/teams/:teamId/tasks - Retrieve all tasks for a team.
PUT /api/teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId - Update a task's information.
DELETE /api/teams/:teamId/tasks/:taskId - Delete a task.




Authorization and Validation:

Ensure that only team owners can perform certain actions (create/update/delete teams and tasks).
Implement validation using Zod for API input and output data.
Implement authentication checks to verify the user's permissions.



Components Needed:

Team Management Component:


Purpose: This component will allow users to create, update, and delete teams.
Steps to Create:
•	Create a new Vue component file (e.g., TeamManagement.vue).
•	Design the UI with forms for team creation and update.
•	Utilize VeeValidate for form validation.
•	Implement methods to handle form submissions.
•	Integrate these components into the appropriate pages or sections.

Task Filtering Component:

Purpose: Enable users to filter tasks based on their status (completed, pending).
Steps to Create:
Create a new Vue component file (e.g., TaskFilter.vue).
Design the UI with checkboxes or buttons for each status.
Implement methods to handle status changes.
Emit events to notify the parent component about the selected filters.
Integrate this component into the page displaying tasks.





Pagination Component:

Purpose: Implement pagination for displaying a limited number of tasks per page.
Steps to Create:
Create a new Vue component file (e.g., Pagination.vue).
Design the UI with buttons for navigating between pages.
Implement methods to handle page changes.
Emit events to notify the parent component about the selected page.
Integrate this component into the page displaying tasks.


Team Members Management Component:

Purpose: Allow team owners to add or remove team members.
Steps to Create:
Create a new Vue component file (e.g., TeamMembersManagement.vue).
Design the UI with forms or buttons for adding and removing team members.
Implement methods to handle member addition and removal.
Integrate these components into the appropriate pages or sections.
Implement checks to ensure that only team owners can access this feature.

Steps to Create Each Component:

For each component, follow these general steps:
Create a Vue Component File:
Use the Vue CLI or manually create a new .vue file for the component.
Design the UI:
Utilize HTML templates to structure the component's UI.
Apply Tailwind CSS classes for styling, or use any other preferred styling approach.
Implement Methods:
Write methods in the script section of the component to handle user interactions.
For example, methods for form submissions, status changes, page navigation, etc.


Conclusion:

This plan outlines the steps needed to introduce Teams and Team Tasks into the fullstack TypeScript app. 
It covers backend modifications, frontend changes, testing, and documentation updates. 
The bonus section provides additional steps for implementing the Team Members feature if time permits.
